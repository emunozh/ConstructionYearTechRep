----------

This repository contains a set of scripts as complementary information to the
technical note on the use of a diffusion algorithm for the estimation of
construction years of a building stock. We also provide a small data-set for
the reproduction of the algorithm. The data-set is stored in a `hdf` format.

The main script is presented in form of an ipython-notebook that can be
directly render within github of with nbviewer.

The notebook will call the different scripts sored on a sub folder called
*scripts*.
