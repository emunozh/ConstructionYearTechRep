----------

This repository contains a set of scripts as complementary information to the
technical note on the use of a diffusion algorithm for the estimation of
construction years of a building stock. We also provide a small data-set for
the reproduction of the algorithm. The data-set is stored in a `hdf` format.

The main script is presented in form of an ipython-notebook that can be
directly render within github of with nbviewer.

The notebook will call the different scripts sored on a sub folder called
*scripts*.

## Needed libraries to run the scripts:

### Python 
* [python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [ipython-notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Python libraries
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

If you want to use the connection to the `PostgreSQL` database, just drop me
a line!
